## My process

I started the this project by analysing how to approach the problem. The first thing to do was writing all the HTML needed for the project. Then I started styling it to make it look as close as possible to the design. I wrote the whole style with Mobile-first workflow. The next step was writting some javascript code to make it interactive and functional as per the design requirements.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid for the key-pad
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS


### What I learned

I learned that planning how to approach the project before diving to the project is crucial in every project we build. Doing that gave me a direction on where to go next. I have also learnt some new CSS tricks like nesting. When it comes to JS, it greatly improved my coding skills specially supporting multiple themes. I have learnt manipulating html tag attributes while implementing theme switching functionality. 

### Useful resources

- [Basic Calculator implementation with js](https://medium.com/@kshitijsharma94/building-a-simple-calculator-with-html-css-and-javascript-1bda25ce3d80) - This is an article I was referring to. It helped me a lot to plan before writing the actual code. It taught me a lot in building the calculator.
- [Web-Dev_simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw&pp=ygUNY2FsY3VsYXRvciBqcw%3D%3D) - This video made by web-dev-simplified helped me a lot to understand the whole project and his approach was useful. For instance, dividing the the whole thing to managable tasks and solving them one by one. It was helpful.
